### Overview
A Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL burger app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat... and then devour them!
Please check out the launched app on Heroku


The app also has a funny "Whine" feature, where random sound effects are played to grieve a devoured burger. This feature uses jQuery click listeners.

Lastly, the app's front-end design uses Bootstrap. This means that your burgers look just as tasty on mobile as they do on desktop. Please see the screenshots below...
